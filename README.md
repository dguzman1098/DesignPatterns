# DesignPatterns


#SINGLETON
In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts 
the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. 
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.


#BUILDER
The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution 
to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. 
The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction 
of a complex object from its representation.

#PROTOTYPE 
Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a 
lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing. Prototype pattern provides a mechanism 
to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs.

#FACTORY
The Factory Design Pattern or Factory Method Design Pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. According to GoF, this pattern “defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses”.

#ABSTRACTFACTORY
Abstract Factory provides interfaces for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Client software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interfaces to create the concrete objects that are part of the family of objects

#ADAPTER
In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

An example is an adapter that converts the interface of a Document Object Model of an XML document into a tree structure that can be displayed.
